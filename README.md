# Flask - creating API

## About

This repository is my first homework assignment from the Python Pro course. 
This is my first introduction to the Flask framework. 
Our main task is to develop an online food delivery store, using the example of which we will study the Flask framework.

 - I added endpoints to the app.py file, view functions to view.py, and templates to the templates folder. The view functions only have a GET http method.
 - I also added a small script that passes the "raw query" to the database in the db_methods.py file.
